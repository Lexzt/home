    title: About me
    summary: |
      Currently, I am a student in National University of Singapore, pursing a 
      Bachelor of Computing (Honours) in Computer Science. I believe in helping 
      others and striving to be the best in what I do. I am a huge people-person 
      and enjoy talking about the latest technologies trends.

      I have previously worked at 3 different companies and am currently interested 
      in software engineering, artificial intelligence and blockchain. I am also 
      an avid participant in hackathons.

      I also participate with school activities. I was the captain of the computing 
      contract bridge team for the Inter-faculty games and the head of logistics for 
      an orientation camp for about 400 students, where I handled transports and 
      equipments to their respective location. 
      
      I am currently working on my own startup during my free time to further 
      improve myself.
